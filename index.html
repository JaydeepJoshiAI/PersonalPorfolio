                                With a rapid rate of change in phishing attacks, the cybersecurity domain
is challenged to identify a wide range of phishing attempts reliably and efficiently. Here, we focus on examining the impact of changes in feature space
over the last decade on phishing detection. Three popular datasets from
2012, 2015, and 2020 were evaluated based on the similarity and uniqueness
of features between them. We identified the crucial features that provide comparative results across various phishing datasets. Our experiments achieved
classification results comparable to those of existing work with an average
of 50% fewer features. Consequently, the detection performance of machine
learning models improved significantly with minimal accuracy loss. We also
achieved reasonable accuracies using ensemble feature selection algorithms,
with an average of 80% fewer original features. In addition to quantitative
improvements in the execution time and accuracy of phishing detection, this
work helps identify the characteristic features that must be preserved across
data sets to help organizations adapt to the massive growth in phishing attacks.

                                <li>In this study, we investigate how features' impacts on phishing detection change with time.</li>
                                <li>In multiple phishing datasets, we found the important features that might offer comparative findings. Three well-known datasets from 2012, 2015, and 2020 were compared and contrasted based on the similarities and differences in their feature sets.</li>
                                <li>With an average of 50% less features, our studies produced classification results equivalent to those of the prior study. As a result, machine learning models' detection performance increased significantly without sacrificing accuracy.</li>
                                <li>We also achieved reasonable accuracy using ensemble feature selection techniques, even though using on average 80% less features.</li> -->
